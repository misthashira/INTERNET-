 <h2>  Terminology</h2>
<p> The word <b>  <i> INTERNETTED </i></b>,was used as a early as 1849 meaning interconnected or
     interwoventhe word internet was used  in the year 1974 as the shorthand form of 
     <b><i> INTERNETWORK</i></b>
Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer
     networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks. When it came into
      common use, most publications treated the word Internet as a capitalized 
    proper noun; this has become less common.  <br><br><br> 
    This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize
     new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar. The word is sometimes still
      capitalized to distinguish the global internet 
      from smaller networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook,
       recommend the lowercase form in every case.
    In 2016, the Oxford English Dictionary found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion
     printed and online sources, "Internet" was capitalized in 54% of cases.
     The terms internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably;
     it is common to speak of "going on the Internet" when using a web browser to view web 
      However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of Internet services,

<p>

In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department
 of Defense funded research into time-sharing of computers.
  Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, 
  started in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965.
 After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed
  NPL network was incorporated into the design for the ARPANET and other resource sharing networks
   such as the Merit Network and CYCLADES, which were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
</p>
<p>



ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the Network
 Measurement Center at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Henry Samueli School 
 of Engineering and Applied Science directed by Leonard Kleinrock, and the NLS system at SRI 
 International (SRI) by Douglas Engelbart in Menlo Park, California, on 29 October 1969.
 The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center at the University of
  California, Santa Barbara, followed by the University of Utah Graphics Department. In 
  a sign of future growth, 15 sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971. 
   
   These early years were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource
    Sharing. </p>

<p> Early international collaborations for the ARPANET were rare. Connections were made in 1973 
to the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) via a satellite station in Tanum, Sweden,
 and to Peter Kirstein's research group at University College London which provided a gateway
  to British academic networks. The ARPA projects and international working groups led to the
   development of various protocols and standards by which multiple separate networks could
    become a single network or "a network of networks". In 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn
     used the term internet as a shorthand for internetwork in RFC 675, and later RFCs 
     repeated this use  Cerf and Khan credit Louis Pouzin with important influences on TCP/IP
      design. Commercial PTT providers were concerned with developing X.25 public data networks. </p>
      

      <p> Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded
 the Computer Science Network (CSNET). In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized,
  which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks. TCP/IP network access 
  expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access
   to supercomputer sites in the United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s
    and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s. The NSFNet expanded into academic and research
     organizations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 1988-89. Although other network
      protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning 
      of the Internet as an intercontinental network. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs)
       emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 
       1990. </p>

       <p>Steady advances in semiconductor technology and optical networking created new economic 
 opportunities for commercial involvement in the expansion of the network in its core
  and for delivering services to the public. In mid-1989, MCI Mail and Compuserve 
  established connections to the Internet, delivering email and public access products
   to the half million users of the Interneokm mo m0lt.Just months later, on 1 January 1990,
  PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks
 hat added to the core of the commercial Internet of later years. </p>
 <p>  In March 1990,the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe 
  was installed between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust communications
   than were apable with satellites.Six months later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing
  WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, after two years of lobbying CERN management.
  By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:
 the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML),
 the first Web browser (which was also a HTML editor and could access Usenet newsgroups
  and FTP files), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first
   web server, and the first Web pages that described the project itself. </p>
   <p> In 1991 the Commercial Internet eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with
 the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Stanford Federal Credit Union
 was the first financial institution to offer online Internet banking services to 
 all of its members in October 1994. In 1996, OP Financial Group, also a
   cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first Europe.
 By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was
 decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial
  traffic. </p>

  <p> As technology advanced and commercial opportunities fueled reciprocal growth, the volume of
   Internet traffic started experiencing similar characteristics as that of the scaling of MOS
    transistors, exemplified by Moore's law, doubling every 18 months. This growth, formalized as Edholm's law, was catalyzed by advances in MOS technology, laser light wave systems, and noise performance.[46]

Since 1995, the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise
of near instant communication by email, instant messaging, telephony (Voice over Internet
Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls, and the World Wide Web with its
discussion forums, blogs, social networking services, and online shopping sites.
Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber
optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more. </p>
<p> The Internet continues 
to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce,
 entertainment and social networking services. During the late 1990s, it was estimated 
 that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth
 in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%. This growth is 
 often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the
 network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages
 vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over
 the network. </p>
 <p> As of 31 March 2011, the estimated total number of Internet users was
 2.095 billion (30.2% of world population). It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet
 carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication. By 2000
 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated
 information was carried over the Internet.

 <h1><u> Advantages of the Internet</u></h1>
 <p>The Internet is one of the powerful creations that offer people endless knowledge
  and entertainment. Today the Internet plays a critical role in many areas. 
  There are multiple advantages of the Internet, below is given a few list of benefits of the
   Internet.</p>
<h2> Connectivity, communication, and sharing </h2> 
<p> In the past days, if you sent a letter or someone sent you, it could take days ,weeks and sometimes
 even months to a reach letter at the destination. In modern times, you can send a letter or
  important information to anyone in the e-mail all over the world through the Internet. And,
 it often will be delivered to the destination in less than a minute.</p>
 <h2>Address, mapping, and contact information</h2>
<p>The Internet can help users to provide information almost every place in the world on the map
 with the help of GPS technology. You can find businesses in your area or the quickest route
  to your location. Although, today's search engines are most powerful to know the user's 
 location and help offer the relevant searches for your area. Also, it can provide you the
 contact information or address of any showroom or other services man. For example, if you
   want to get the address of an electrician, you can  search for an electrician
  and get a list of local electricians in your area with their address.</p> 
 <h2>Selling and making money</h2>
 <p>If you want to sell products and services or run a business, the Internet is the best place
 to sell goods. Because anyone can find and access your website all over the world
 with the help of the Internet. With online business, you are able to sell goods
  every day at all times as the Internet is always on and always available. Also,
  the Internet provides the advantage to promote your business online in the world 
      through advertising. Additionally,   there are several ways to earn money
     online by performing other online services.</p>
     <h2>Banking, bills, and shopping</h2>
     <p>If you want to view your bank balance without leaving your home, 
         the Internet offers you the benefit to access your bank account to view the balance.
          Also, you can send money, pay bills ,electronically, or many other services you 
           can complete through the Internet.</p>
           <p> Another advantage of the Internet is online shopping, which allows people
            to find products of interest and buy them without having to visit a store.
             You can compare prices between companies for any product through the Internet.
              Also, you can get help to make better purchasing decisions by online reviews, 
                which describes what others think about a product. </p>

 <h1>LETS TAKE FROM THE TOP </h1>
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


 <h2><u> ADDICTION , TIME WASTER AND CAUSES DISTRACTION </u></p></h2>
      <p> If any person is spending to much time on the internet connected devices,
         he can be <b>addicted to the internet .</b> An internet addactive person can lead to spending his 
            precious time on the internet ,rather than doing something productive.People who is addictive to 
               the internet can  hamper workplace productivity as well .</p>
               
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


            <h2>  <u> BULLYING [ONLINE] ,TROLLS,STALKERS,AND CRIME</u></h2>
             <p>    A person who uses the internet very frequently can face abusive or troll's people.
                    cyberbullying is also increasing rapidly over the years . sometimes, you can be tracked
                 on the inrternet by hackers or un authorized person ; they can be harm ful to you by stealing 
                of your personal information</p>
                <p> if you are spending your more time on the internet , so it will be very easy for hackers
                    to  find and get your personal information through various means .     </p>
                    
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


                    <h2><u> SPAM AND ADVERTIZING </u></h2>
                    <p>  The internet is the best place to advertise any service or product
                        as compared to the traditional advertising methods 
                        (for example,TV,newspapper,and radio). But you might see more spam in your inbox than junk
                        mail in real life because digital advertising can be sent on a massive scale . 
                    </p>

                    <h2>  <u>  PORNOGRAPHIC AND VIOLENT IMAGES </u></h2>
                     <p>  In mordern times, Also , there are various resources that cointain
                          a large amount of data,  such as  <b>wikipeda,</b> and some sites are also
                          available that have less desirable content  . Accordingly,users can see pornograpic
     or violent images that they may not want to see while using sites.
                     </p>
                      
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>                        

<h2>  <u> CYBER THEFT AND HACKING   </u></h2>
<p>  Hacking is the most common disadvantage of the internet  
    because personal information in social media is very important to hackers 
    if they can get acess to your information especially bank information they can clear your account 
     and all the money on it wil be atomatically be transfered to their account </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>                        



                     <h2>  <u> AFFECTS PATIENTS AND FOCUS </u></h2>
            <p>The sites have instant gratification effect that we use on the internet every day . on - demand ,
                they also offer a large amount of meun of things to experience and think at any moment . 
            </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>       
             
<h2><u> NOT A SAFE PLACE FOR CHILDERN  </u></h2>
<p> The internet  may not be more useful for childern as they are spending  a lot of time on the internet.  
    Although the interneet has many good features , although about 40% of childern of today  spend time 
    on the internet doing research ,for assignment ,for better undastanding of school work and to learn further
    while majourity of the childern especially the teenagers and the preteens   are distracted by  the  unethical
    and ponographic communities that are available on the internet that are used to distract their minds 
    therefore the internet is not beneficial for childern
</p>
<br>
<br>                        
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2><u> VIRUSES /MALWARE</u></h2>
<p> A virus is the most common type of malware that can execute itself and spread by infecting other programs
     or files. A worm can self-replicate without a host program and typically spreads without any interaction
      from the malware authors. A Trojan horse is designed to appear as a legitimate software program to gain
       access to a system.</p>
